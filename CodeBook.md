### Getting and cleanning data
Folowing step by step in README.md, we'll get tidy data stored in file which name's "**tidy_data.txt**" 
### Summarizes the resulting data fields in "**tidy_data.txt**".
#### Identifiers
- Subjects - The ID of the test subject
- Activities - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
